# Memory-Game
In this project I have used HTML,CSS and Javascript.<br>
In this game we are supposed to match the images with each other till all the images are matched<br>
Every time the page is refreshed the position of the images are randomized.<br>
In case the user gets a wrong match,an alert is displayed to try again.<br>
Here are some previews:<br>
